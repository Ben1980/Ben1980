# Benjamin Mahr

I'm a software engineer (with a background in mechanical engineering) and head of the software development department at [KISSsoft AG][kisssoft]. I'm strongly focused on solutions to keep our over 3M LOC applications maintainable and keeping the architecture of the application neat. Besides, I'm part of the core team maintaining and developing the contact analysis (numerical analysis of meshing gears) functionality our software provides.

I'm strongly convinced of learning and exploring new topics by teaching/explaining them and therefore I'm running my blog [thoughts-on-coding.com][blog] where I occasionally blog about software engineering topics I'm interested in.
